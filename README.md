# press to code
You can begin a board with `press to code` to run javascript when you right click it.
This is only available to owners of worlds lobbies.
The javascript can interact with the Bloxd.io game api.

Please use [our discord](https://discord.gg/vwMp5y25RX) to report any issues you come across or features you'd like to see added.

## Notes

- Global variable `myId` stores the PlayerID of who is running the code.
- You can use `api.log` or `console.log` for printing and debugging (they do the same thing).
- You can use `Date.now()` instead of `api.now()` if you prefer, both return the time in milliseconds.
- Comments like `/* comment */` work, but comments like `// comment` don't work right now.
- Normally you can't edit a code board after placing it, but you can currently work around this by putting a space before `press to code`.
- Boards are very small - alternative places to write code are coming soon, for now you can work around this by using multiple boards.

## Examples

Set player health to 99, and then print it:
```ts
 press to code
s = "setHealth"
api[s](myId, 99)
g = "getHealth"
api[g](myId)
```

Make the player jump:
```ts
 press to code
s="setVelocity"
f = api[s]
f(myId, 0, 9, 0)
```

Push the player
```ts
 press to code
a = "apply"
a += "Impulse"
f = api[a]
f(myId, 9, 0, 9)
```

Define a function to get the IDs of players using api.getPlayerIds():
```ts
 press to code
getIds = () => {
g="getPlayerIds"
ids = api[g]()
return ids
}
```

Use the function above to get IDs excluding your own ID:
```ts
 press to code
ids = getIds()
ids.filter(i =>
{
const me = myId
return i !== me
})
```

```ts
